		    <h3>&#128204; Quote &#128204;</h3>
		    <p><em>"If you have no confidence in self, you are twice defeated in the race of life"</em> <br>~ Marcus Garvey</p>
		    <br>
		    <p>My interpretation of this quote is that if you have no self-confidence, then you are setting yourself back, 
		    preventing yourself from reaching your own goal. Not only are you defeated by yourself, but also by not doing 
		    what you set out to do. This quote was taken from Marcus Garvey, Jamaica's first National Hero. He was a source
		    of inpiration to many people, including me. He advocated for the rights of black persons, race pride and self reliance.
		    Today, his influence still impacts the people of Jamaica.</p>

		    <h3>&#128161; AI Business Idea &#128161;</h3>
		    <p>My favourite idea on the list is AI-based smart home management. I believe it is a profitable business idea as it blends
		    technology, convenience and security into home life. Using  applications like Samsung Smart Things, users can manipulate
		    temperature, lighting and even manage security remotely.<br>
            As a student living in Jamaica, AI-based smart home management could make a significant impact on security and accessibility. 
            AI-powered cameras and motion sensors could help to protect against potential break-ins in high-crime areas. Elderly or 
            disabled members of the population could benefit from the convenience of voice-activated or automated systems, minimizing 
            physical strain on their bodies. <br>
            While home-AI products offer multiple advantages, they also come with their share of ethical challenges. These challenges 
            include privacy, as the devices constantly monitor real-time activity, raising questions about data protection as well as, 
            overdependence where users rely too much on the devices and lose their sense of personal awareness or responsibility. <br>
            My solution to these problems is to utilize the option to avoid data sharing and promote digital literacy to teach users how 
            to manage their systems without overdepending on them. An example of an AI smart home management application is Samsung 
            SmartThings. It grants you the ability to monitor and control smart devices, home appliances, TVs, and speakers registered 
            on their server (Smartthings, 2024). </p>
