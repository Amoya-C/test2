		    <h3>&#128214; Chapter 4 &#128214;</h3>
		    <p><strong>“The major reason for setting a goal is for what it makes of you
to accomplish it.”</strong></p>
		    <p>Micheal meets Charlie at Mack’s Diner and shares that he’s not advancing in his career. When asked, he shares that he doesn’t 
		    have any goals. Charlie suggests that a lack of goals is why Micheal feels so unfulfilled and gives him advice that could help. 
		    Charlie tells Micheal that he can start by writing down his goals (once written down, the goal is more “real” and here you can start 
		    working towards it once you can visualize it). Charlie then brings up Mr Davis’ iconic line, which he uses to say that progression 
		    isn’t in the achievement that is reached, but in the person you become while trying to reach it, evidently showing a transformation through
		    goals. He then expresses that Micheal, while he can’t change his destination overnight, he can change his direction overnight. (Meaning that 
		    you won’t reach a goal immediately, you can however, take steps to reach it). Charlie introduces the concept of breaking down goals into steps.
		    He brings up long-range (10 years), mid-range(5 years), short-range(1-2 years) and micro-range goals(months). After being prompted by Micheal, 
		    Charlie gives an example of breaking down goals using a business that needs $50,000 to start.</p>
		    <p>In my academic life, I use some of the tips that Charlie gave to Micheal. Each time I receive an assignment, which would be my goal, I write 
		    them down so that I can “bring them into reality”. Actually looking at your goals instead of visualizing them helps one to mentally get started 
		    on achieving them. The point of making a goal is for who you’ll become trying to accomplish it. In trying to finish my assignments, I find new ways 
		    to find information in efficient ways, improving my resourcefulness. As stated in the book, ‘you cannot change your destiny overnight, but you can 
		    change your direction overnight.’ Receiving group projects are frustrating, and often cannot be completed in one day. Instead of being frustrated with 
		    reaching the end goal, I complete the small steps leading up to completion like doing research, making diagrams, etc. </p>

		    <h3>&#128214; Chapter 5 &#128214;</h3>
		    <p><strong>“Every day has many opportunities, but only one best opportunity.” </strong></p>
		    <p>The purpose of this chapter is to communicate that time is valuable and how we use it determines our lives. Charlie shares another quote from Mr. Davis
		    that essentially means we can either be disciplined enough to do what it takes to achieve our goals or live with the regret of failing to do so. We are 
		    presented opportunities daily, however, we should choose the one that best aligns with our long-term goals. Micheal states that he spends his days worrying
		    about bills. Charlie warns that choosing urgency over importance is a common trap to fall into. He also states that if you don’t master your time, it will 
		    control you instead.</p>
		    <p>Every time I choose to study or practice coding instead of procrastinating, I am being disciplined. In order to use my time wisely, I identify the best 
		    opportunity that I have, which is a task that can get me to my goals. Another tip that Charlie gave was to prioritize the important over the urgent. I focus
		    on what truly matters and I don’t let last minute distractions interfere. We all have the ability to control our priorities and pace. I choose to do at least 
		    one productive task for the day.</p>

		    <h3>&#128214; Chapter 6 &#128214;</h3>
		    <p><strong>“Don't join an easy crowd; you won't grow. Go where the expectations
and the demands to perform are high.”</strong></p>
		    <p>Charlie tells Micheal to surround himself with people who share the same goals and values as him. Charlie asks Micheal to reflect on his three friends who
		    have undesirable lifestyles. He challenges Mike to think whether these friendships are helping or holding him back. Mr Davis’ principle for managing relationships
		    is brought up. Disassociation is ending harmful relationships, limited association is spending less time with people who don’t share the same goals as you and expanded
		    association is spending more time with those that have the same goals as you.</p>
		    <p>Having people in your life that have the same values and qualities as you do positively impacts your life. They promote you to do better. Distancing myself from persons
		    who will hold me back will give me the opportunity to focus more on my goals.</p>

		    <h3>&#128214; Chapter 7 &#128214;</h3>
		    <p><strong>“Formal education will make you a living. Self-education
will make you a fortune.”</strong></p>
            <p>This chapter speaks on formal education not being the end of our learning journey. Many people think that because they graduated high school or college that they've learned
            all that they’ve needed, but that isn’t true. After school, it becomes your responsibility to acquire skills and learn information to help you progress in life. As Mr Davis 
            phrases it, ‘Formal education will make you a living. Self-education will make you a fortune.’ Self-education gives the opportunity to gain experience and knowledge at your
            own pace that often cannot be obtained from attending school. There are three ways to learn that can improve lives. The first is to read books. The second is to observe successful
            people and learn from them. Lastly, the third is to reflect on one's choices and treat them as learning experiences.</p>
            <p>As a university student, I rarely find myself with free time. When I do, I try, as best as possible, to practice coding languages like Java and HTML. I also make time to read 
            books in order to improve my vocabulary and writing skills. I have observed certain qualities from successful people and one thing I can try to apply to my life is their discipline. 
            The ability to set aside distractions to complete or work towards your goal is an essential part of being successful in life. Finally, learning from one’s rights and wrongs in their 
            experiences is a significant part of progressing. Knowing the reasons behind your actions, whether right or wrong, helps with great reasoning skills.</p>
